I've always been fascinated by how things work and how to build or repair them. Thanks to my many years of experience as an industrial mechanic, carpenter, event technician and programmer, I am now able to turn almost every crazy idea into reality. So if you want something unusual to be built, feel free to contact me


Here I show some of my projects that I built in my spare time. Everything is completely planned, designed and built by me.
